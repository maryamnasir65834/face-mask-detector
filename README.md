Project Description
------------
After the breakout of the worldwide pandemic COVID-19, there arises a severe need of protection mechanisms, face masks being a primary one. The basic aim of this project is to detect the presence of a face mask on human faces on live streaming video. We have used deep learning to develop our face detector model. We have used basic concepts of transfer learning in neural networks to finally output the presence or absence of a face mask in a video stream. Experimental results show that our model performs well on the test data with 100% and 99% precision and recall, respectively.

This application is able to:
  1.  Detect multiple faces through the webcam
  2.  Process and detect face masks
  3.  Show result accuracy

Usage
------------
This face mask detector could potentially be used to help ensure your safety and the safety of others. To reduce the spread of COVID-19, people have been advised to wear face masks to protect themselves from the deadly virus. Similarly, many hospital wards require visitors to wear face masks. Along with the smog situation arising, the government has issued notices to wear face masks to protect the people from health issues.
Monitoring a population of 220 million people is not an easy task. With this project, we are hoping to help automate the monitoring process, making it easier and efficient, thus saving resources such as time and money.
